[![Akash](_docs/img/logo-label-black.svg "Akash")](#overview)

[Akash](https://akash.network) is a secure, transparent, and decentralized cloud computing marketplace that connects those who need computing resources (tenants) with those that have computing capacity to lease (providers).

For a high-level overview of the Akash protocol and network economics, check out the [whitepapers](https://akash.network/research); a detailed protocol definition can be 
found in the [design documentation](https://docs.akash.network); and the target workload definition spec is [here](https://docs.akash.network/sdl).

# Branching and Versioning

The `master` branch contains new features and is under active development; the `mainnet/main` branch contains the current, stable release.

* **stable** releases will have even minor numbers ( `v0.8.0` ) and be cut from the `mainnet/main` branch.
* **unstable** releases will have odd minor numbers ( `v0.9.0` ) and be cut from the `master` branch.

## Akash Suite

Akash Suite is the reference implementation of the [Akash Protocol](https://akash.network/l/whitepaper). Akash is an actively-developed prototype currently focused on the distributed marketplace functionality.

The Suite is composed of one binary, `akash`, which contains a ([tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint)-powered) blockchain node that
implements the decentralized exchange as well as client functionality to access the exchange and network data in general.

# Roadmap and contributing

Akash is written in Golang and is Apache 2.0 licensed - contributions are welcomed whether that means providing feedback, testing existing and new feature or hacking on the source.

## Building from Source

 * [Dependencies](#dependencies)
 * [Building](#building)

### Dependencies

Akash is developed and tested with [golang 1.13.1+](https://golang.org/).  Building requires a working [golang](https://golang.org/) installation, a properly set `GOPATH`, and `$GOPATH/bin` present in `$PATH`.

 Most golang libraries will be installed via [`go modules`](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules),
 however the following packages:
 
 ```
github.com/vektra/mockery/.../
k8s.io/code-generator/...
sigs.k8s.io/kind
golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer
 ```
 
 will be installed globally with their binaries placed in `$GOPATH/bin` by `make devdeps-install`.

### Building

```sh
go get -d github.com/ovrclk/akash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ovrclk/akash
make deps-install
make

# dev environment only:
make setup-devenv
```

## Running

We use thin integration testing environments to simplify
the development and testing process.  We currently have two environments:

* [Single node](_run/lite): simple (no workloads) single node running locally.
* [Single node with workloads](_run/single): single node and provider running locally, running workloads within a virtual machine.
* [full k8s](_run/kube): same as above but with node and provider running inside Kubernetes.

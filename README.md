[![Akash](_docs/img/logo-label-black.svg "Akash")](#overview)

[Akash](https://akash.network) is a secure, transparent, and decentralized cloud computing marketplace that connects those who need computing resources (tenants) with those that have computing capacity to lease (providers).

For a high-level overview of the Akash protocol and network economics, check out the [whitepaper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVwsi5kTrg7UcUEGi5UfdheVLBWoHjze2pHy4tLqYvLYv); a detailed protocol definition can be 
found in the [design documentation](https://docs.akash.network); and the target workload definition spec is [here](https://docs.akash.network/sdl).

# Branching and Versioning

The `main` branch contains new features and is under active development; the `mainnet/main` branch contains the current, stable release.

* **stable** releases will have even minor numbers ( `v0.8.0` ) and be cut from the `mainnet/main` branch.
* **unstable** releases will have odd minor numbers ( `v0.9.0` ) and be cut from the `main` branch.

## Akash Suite

Akash Suite is the reference implementation of the [Akash Protocol](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdV52bF7j4utynJ6L11RgG93FuJiUmBH1i7pRD6NjUt6B). Akash is an actively-developed prototype currently focused on the distributed marketplace functionality.

The Suite is composed of one binary, `akash`, which contains a ([tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint)-powered) blockchain node that
implements the decentralized exchange as well as client functionality to access the exchange and network data in general.

## Get Started with Akash

# Roadmap and contributing

Akash is written in Golang and is Apache 2.0 licensed - contributions are welcomed whether that means providing feedback, testing existing and new feature or hacking on the source.

## Development environment
[This doc](https://github.com/akash-network/node/blob/main/_docs/development-environment.md) guides through setting up local development environment

Akash is developed and tested with [golang 1.16.0+](https://golang.org/). 
Building requires a working [golang](https://golang.org/) installation, a properly set `GOPATH`, and `$GOPATH/bin` present in `$PATH`.
It is also required to have C/C++ compiler installed (gcc/clang) as there are C dependencies in use (libusb/libhid)
Akash build process and examples are heavily tied to Makefile.


## Building from Source
Command below will compile akash executable and put it into `.cache/bin`
```shell
make akash # akash is set as default target thus `make` is equal to `make akash`
```
once binary compiled it exempts system-wide installed akash within akash repo

## Running

We use thin integration testing environments to simplify
the development and testing process.  We currently have three environments:

* [Single node](_run/lite): simple (no workloads) single node running locally.
* [Single node with workloads](_run/single): single node and provider running locally, running workloads within a virtual machine.
* [full k8s](_run/kube): same as above but with node and provider running inside Kubernetes.

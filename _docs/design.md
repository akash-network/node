### Workflow

* [Users](#users) [define](#deployment) desired infrastructure, workloads to run on infrastructure, and how workloads can connect to one another.
  * Desired lifetime of resources is expressed via [collateral](#resourcegroup) requirements.
* [Orders](#order) are generated from the [user's definition](#deployment).
* [Datacenters](#datacenters) [bid](#fulfillment) on open [orders](#order).
* The [bid](#fulfillment) with lowest price gets [matched](#matchopenorders) with [order](#order) to create a [lease](#lease).
* Once [lease](#lease) is reached, workloads and topology are delivered to [datacenter](#datacenters).
* [Datacenter](#datacenters) deploy workloads and allow connectivity as specified by the user.
* If a [datacenter](#datacenters) fails to maintain lease, collateral is transferred to user, and a new [order](#order) is crated for the desired resources.

## Deployments

Once resources have been procured, clients must distribute their workloads to providers so that they
can execute on the leased resources.  We refer to the current state of the clientâ€™s workloads on the
Photon Network as a "deployment".

A user describes their desired deployment in a "manifest".  The manifest contains workload
definitions, configuration, and connection rules.  Providers use workload definitions and
configuration to execute the workloads on the resources theyâ€™re providing, and use the connection
rules to build an overlay network and firewall configurations.

A hash of the manifest is known as the deployment "version" and is stored on the blockchain-based
distributed database.

### Workflow

1. Stack infrastructure is submitted to the ledger.
1. Ask orders are generated for resources defined in the stack infrastructure.
1. Providers (data centers) bid on orders.
1. Leases are reached by matching bid and ask orders.
1. Stack manifest is distributed to deployment data centers (lease providers).
1. Datacenters deploy workloads and distribute connection parameters to all other deployment datacenters.
1. Overlay network is established to allow for connectivity between workloads.

### Manifest Distribution

Each on-chain deployment contains a hash of the manifest.  This hash represents the deployment
_version_.

The manifest contains sensitive information which should only be shared with participants of the
deployment.  This poses a problem for self-managed deployments - Photon must distribute the workload
definition autonomously, without revealing its contents to unnecessary participants.

To address these issues, we devised a peer-to-peer file sharing scheme in which lease participants
distribute the manifest to one another as needed.  The protocol runs off-chain over a TLS
connection; each participant can verify the manifest they received by computing its hash and
comparing this with the deployment version that is stored on the blockchain-backed distributed
database.

In addition to providing private, secure, autonomous manifest distribution, the peer-to-peer
protocol also enables fast distribution of large manifests to a large number of datacenters.

### Overlay Network

By default, a workloadâ€™s network is isolated - nothing can connect to it. While this is secure, it
is not practical for real-world applications. For example, consider a simple web application:
end-user browsers should have access to the web tier workload, and the web tier needs to communicate
to the database workload. Furthermore, the web tier may not be hosted in the same datacenter as the
database.

On the Photon Network, clients can selectively allow communications to and between workloads by
defining a connection topology within the manifest. Datacenters use this topology to configure
firewall rules and to create a secure network between individual workloads as needed.

To support secure cross-datacenter communications, providers expose workloads to each other through
a mTLS tunnel. Each workload-to-workload connection uses a distinct tunnel.

Before establishing these tunnels, providers generate a TLS certificate for each required tunnel and
exchange these certificates with the necessary peer providers.  Each providerâ€™s root certificate is
stored on the blockchain-based distributed database, enabling peers to verify the authenticity of
the certificates it receives.

Once certificates are exchanged, providers establish an authenticated tunnel and connect the
workloadâ€™s network to it.  All of this is transparent to the workloads themselves - they can connect
to one another through stable addresses and standard protocols.

## Automation

The dynamic nature of cloud infrastructure is both a blessing and a curse for operations management.
That new resources can be provisioned at will is a blessing; the exploding management overhead and
complexity of said resources is a curse.  The goal of DevOps -- the practice of managing deployments
programmatically -- is to alleviate the pain points of cloud infrastructure by leveraging its
strengths.

The Photon Network was built from the ground up to provide DevOps engineers with a simple but
powerful toolset for creating highly-automated deployments.  The toolset is comprised of the
primitives that enable non-management applications -- generic workloads and overlay networks -- and
can be leveraged to create autonomous, self-managed systems.

Self-managed deployments on Photon are a simple matter of creating workloads that manage their own
deployment themselves.  A DevOps engineer may employ a workload that updates DNS entries as
providers join or leave the deployment; tests response times of web tier applications; and scales up
and down infrastructure (in accordance with permissions and constraints defined by the client) as
needed based on any number of input metrics.  The "management tier" may be spread across all
datacenters for a deployment, with global state maintained by a distributed database running over
the secure overlay network.

### Examples

#### Latency-Optimized Deployment

Many web-based applications are "latency-sensitive" - lower response times from application servers
translates into a dramatically improved end-user experience.  Modern deployments of such
applications employ content delivery networks (CDNs) to deliver static content such as images to end
users quickly.

CDNs provide reduced latency by distributing content so that it is geographically close to the users
that are accessing it.  Deployments on the Photon Network can not only replicate this approach, but
beat it - Photon gives clients the ability to place dynamic content close to an applicationâ€™s users.

To implement a self-managed "dynamic delivery network" on Photon, a DevOps engineer would include a
management tier in their deployment which monitors the geographical location of clients.  This
management tier would add and remove datacenters across the globe, provisioning more resources in
regions where user activity is high, and less resources in regions where user participation is low.

#### Machine Learning Deployment

Machine learning applications employ a large number of nodes to parallelize computations involving
large datasets.  They do their work in "batches" - there is no "steady state" of capacity that is
required.

A machine learning application on Photon may use a management tier to proactively procure resources
within a single datacenter.  As a machine learning task begins, the management tier can "scale up"
the number of nodes for it; when a task completes, the resources provisioned for it can be
relinquished.

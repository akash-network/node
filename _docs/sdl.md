## Deployment Configuration

Deployment services, datacenters, pricing, etc.. are described by a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/start.html) configuration file.  Configuration files may end in `.yml` or `.yaml`.

A complete deployment has the following sections:

 * [version](#version)
 * [services](#services)
 * [profiles](#profiles)
 * [deployment](#deployment)

An example deployment configuration can be found [here](deployment.yaml).

### version

Indicates version of Akash configuration file.  Currently only `"1.5"` is accepted.


### services

The top-level `services` entry contains a map of workloads to be ran on the Akash deployment.  Each key is a service name; values are a map containing the following keys:

| Name | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `image` | Yes | Docker image of the container |
| `depends-on` | No | List of services which must be brought up before the current service |
| `command` | No | Custom command use when executing container |
| `args` | No | Arguments to custom command use when executing the container |
| `env` |  No | Environment variables to set in running container |
| `expose` | No | Entities allowed to connect to to the services.  See [services.expose](#servicesexpose). |

#### services.expose

`expose` is a list describing what can connect to the service.  Each entry is a map containing one or more of the following fields:

| Name | Required | Meaning |
|--- | --- | --- |
| `port` | Yes | Container port to expose |
| `as` | No | Port number to expose the container port as |
| `accept` | No | List of hosts to accept connections for |
| `proto` | No | Protocol type (`tcp`,`http`, or `https`) |
| `to` | No | List of entities allowed to connect.  See [services.expose.to](#servicesexposeto) |

The `port` value governs the default `proto` value as follows:

| `port` | `proto` default |
| --- | --- |
| 80 | http |
| 443 | https |
| all others | tcp |

#### services.expose.to

`expose.to` is a list of clients to accept connections from.  Each item is a map with one or more of the following entries:

| Name | Value | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `service` | A service in this deployment | | Allow the given service to connect |
| `global`  | `true` or `false` | `false` | If true, allow connections from outside of the datacenter |


If no service is given and `global` is true, any client can connect from anywhere (web servers typically want this).

If a service name is given and `global` is `false`, only the services in the current datacenter can connect.
If a service name is given and `global` is `true`, services in other datacenters for this deployment can connect.

If `global` is `false` then a service name must be given.

### profiles

The `profiles` section contains named compute and placement profiles to be used in the [deployment](#deployment).

#### profiles.compute

`profiles.compute` is map of named compute profiles.  Each profile specifies compute resources to be leased for each service instance
uses uses the profile.

Example:

This defines a profile named `web` having resource requirements of 2 vCPUs, 2 gigabytes of memory, and 5 gigabytes of storage space available.


```yaml
web:
  cpu: 2
  memory: "2Gi"
  storage: "5Gi"
```

`cpu` units represent a vCPU share and can be fractional.  When no suffix is present the value represents
a fraction of a whole CPU share.  With a `m` suffix, the value represnts the number of milli-CPU shares (1/1000 of a CPU share).

Example:

| Value | CPU-Share |
| --- | --- |
| `1` | 1 |
| `0.5` | 1/2 |
| `"100m"` | 1/10 |
| `"50m"` | 1/20 |

`memory`, `storage` units are described in bytes.  The following suffixes are allowed for simplification:

| Suffix | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `k` | 1000 |
| `Ki` | 1024 |
| `M`  | 1000^2 |
| `Mi`  | 1024^2 |
| `G`  | 1000^3 |
| `Gi`  | 1024^3 |
| `T`  | 1000^4 |
| `Ti`  | 1024^4 |
| `P`  | 1000^5 |
| `Pi`  | 1024^5 |
| `E`  | 1000^6 |
| `Ei`  | 1024^6 |

#### profiles.placement

`profiles.placement` is map of named datacenter profiles.  Each profile specifies required datacenter attributes and pricing
configuration for each [compute profile](#profilescompute) that will be used within the datacenter.

Example:

```yaml
westcoast:
  attributes:
    region: us-west
  pricing:
    web:
      denom: akash
      amount: 8
    db:
      denom: akash
      amount: 100
```

This defines a profile named `westcoast` having required attributes `{region="us-west"}`, and with a max price for
the `web` and `db` [compute profiles](#profilescompute) of 8 and 15 tokens per block, respectively.

### deployment

The `deployment` section defines how to deploy the services.  It is a mapping of service name to deployment configuration.

Each service to be deployed has an entry in the `deployment`.  This entry is maps [datacenter profiles](#profilesplacement) to
[compute profiles](#profilescompute) to create a final desired configuration for the resources required for the service.

Example:

```yaml
web:
  westcoast:
    profile: web
    count: 20
```

This says that the 20 instances of the `web` service should be deployed to a datacenter matching the `westcoast` [datacenter profile](#profilesplacement).  Each instance will have 
the resources defined in the `web` [compute profile](#profilescompute) available to it.
